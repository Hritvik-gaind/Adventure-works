# Adventure-works

## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on developing a **Balanced Scorecard Dashboard** for **Adventure Works**, a company that manufactures and sells bikes, clothing, and accessories. The executive team at Works uses the balanced scorecard method to manage and monitor the organization’s performance across key business perspectives.
